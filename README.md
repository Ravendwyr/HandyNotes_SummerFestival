HandyNotes - The Midsummer Festival
===================================


What it does
------------

This addon displays locations of unvisited bonfires on the worldmap and minimap while the Midsummer Festival is active (21st June - 4th July).  
If you also have TomTom or Cartographer installed, you can right-click on a marker to create a Waypoint arrow.

This addon is the spiritual successor to [TourGuide - The Midsummer Festival](https://github.com/EthanCentaurai/TourGuide_MidsummerFestival), re-written as a HandyNotes plug-in due to TourGuide being broken and abandoned.

Requires [HandyNotes](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes) to work.


Configuration
-------------

There are a few options you can modify, including:

* Icon size.
* Icon transparency.
* Show all icons, even if you have already visited that bonfire.


Translations
------------

This addon should work for everyone regardless of language, but most of the text is currently only in English.

--------
